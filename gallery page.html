            premium to the issue price. Effwa Infra and Research share price began trading at ₹155.80 per share on NSE SME
            as against its IPO price of ₹82 per share.Effwa Infra and Research IPO listing was in-line with the street estimates.
            Effwa Infra and Research IPO GMP today, or grey market premium today, was ₹143 per share or 174.39% to the issue price.
            However, as NSE has set a price control cap of 90% on the issue price of SME IPOs during the pre-opening session, 
            Effwa Infra and Research IPO listing price was at only 90% premium.

        <p>Ravi Bishnoi’s fielding has always had a touch of athleticism but he took it to a different level in the third T20I 
            against Zimbabwe when he leapt to catch a screamer off Avesh Khan to dismiss Brian Bennett, leaving his India teammate
            in awe.India defeated Zimbabwe by 23 runs on Wednesday to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series but the talk in the 
            dressing room was Bishnoi’s astonishing effort.The pacer said he was left “shocked” for a moment.
           “When he took the catch, I don’t think he got the reaction time. I also did not get the reaction time (to see what happened).
            I was, in fact, shocked how he took that catch,” said Avesh, who took two wickets as India restricted Zimbabwe to 159/6 in
            the chase of 182.Avesh added that the wicket should be credited to Bishnoi’s account for the sheer effort.

        <p>The Supreme Court on Friday granted interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal in a money-laundering case linked to excise policy ‘scam’.
            However, despite the interim bail granted to him, Kejriwal will continue to be in Tihar Jail as he has also been arrested by the
             CBI in a corruption case related to the excise policy scam.A Bench of Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta referred 
             certain legal issues with regard to arrest of an accused under Section 19 and Section 45 of the PMLA to the larger Bench.
             Pronouncing the verdict, Justice Khanna made it clear that his regular bail plea would be decided on merit.The top court 
             asked Kejriwal to furnish bail bonds of Rs 50,000 with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Tihar Jail 
             superintendent and restrained from visiting the Chief Minister’s Office and Delhi Secretariat.

            talks with President Vladimir Putin, with the Kremlin saying the West was watching the trip with “jealousy”. Prime Minister

            It will be Modi’s first visit to Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.The two leaders will review the entire
            range of multifaceted relations between the two countries and exchange views on contemporary regional and global issues of

        <p>The illegal dumping of solid waste in the Ingle rivulet in Dharamsala has been spelling trouble for residents of Sakoh area 
            of Dharamsala who are alleging that solid waste such as plastic was flowing into their fields through the irrigation khull 
            emanating from the rivulet. The rivulet passes through lower Dharamsala and Sakoh areas. The illegal dumping of waste was 
            taking place in the rivulet near the Himachal Pradesh Board of School Education (HPBSE). Huge dumps of plastic waste and 
            construction muck can be seen dumped at the rivulet near the HPBSE head office.Dharam Chand, an area resident, while 
            talking to The Tribune, alleged that waste dumped at the rivulet was polluting their fields. Chand said the khull was 
            brining plastic and construction waste to the fields. “We have complained against illegal dumping of waste reaching our 
            fields to the district administration, but no action has been taken,” he said.

        <p>"Eighth wonder of the world". "Once in a generation". "Cheat code". Jasprit Bumrah has got many nicknames in the Indian 
            dressing room. But perhaps the biggest indicator of his greatness is his ability to impart knowledge, even to coaches 
            and seniors who have been associated with the game for decades. Jasprit Bumrah is an institution not just in fast bowling
            but cricket, in general. The way he thinks about the game, the way he wants to learn, unlearn and keep growing as a 
            cricketer are remarkable. A chat with Bumrah before and after the game is a tutorial in itself.Be it Tests, ODIs or T20Is
            Bumrah is in a league of his own. Throw him the new ball, and he would swing it in all formats. If there is none on 
            offer, it would take just two or three deliveries for him to chalk out a different plan. Need a wicket in the middle
            overs? He would deliver. Want to trap a batter with a bouncer in a Test match? Allow Bumrah to work his magic. Death overs? 
            Bumrah is a specialist.</p>
